# Project Euler Answers

This repository includes my answers for the Project Euler questions. I've mostly written them in C or C++ for performance, but I use Python from time to time to simplify my life and avoid having mental breakdowns. The repository is under the GNU GPL-3.0 License.

In accordance to Project Euler's guidlines, I will only be publishing solutions to the first 100 problems on this repo. However, if you want to see how far I've gone in Project Euler, you can [check out my profile](https://projecteuler.net/profile/random.programmer.guy.png).

# What is Project Euler?

According to the ([official Project Euler website](projecteuler.net)):

> "Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems. The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context."

# What can you use this repository for?

Now, of course, you can use this repository to get the first 100 problems of Project Euler done, but what is the fun of that? What you can do though is using the code in this repository for other projects. I have done my best to comment every function I use in this repository and I have generally tried to make this code as adaptable as possible, so feel free to snatch some functions that I wrote for your own coding adventures! Note that the functions are not always going to be fully optimized

Also, you can use this repo to compare your Project Euler answers to mine.

# Why am I doing this?

As a Computer Science and Mathematics double major student, Project Euler is a great way for me to test my programming and my mathematics skills. Also, a decent number of my friends were doing this too so I decided to give it a try.
