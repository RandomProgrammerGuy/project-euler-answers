# Project Euler Answers

This repository includes my answers for the Project Euler questions. I've mostly written them in C or C++ for performance, but I use Python from time to time to simplify my life and avoid having mental breakdowns. The repository is under the GNU GPL-3.0 License.

# What is Project Euler?

According to the ([official Project Euler website](projecteuler.net)):

> "Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems. The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context."

# Why am I doing this?

As a Computer Science and Mathematics double major student, Project Euler is a great way for me to test my programming and my mathematics skills. Also, a decent number of my friends were doing this too so I decided to give it a try.
